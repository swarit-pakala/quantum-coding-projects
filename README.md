Within the program, the nature of a qubit state vector is investigated. 
More specifically, I have programmed in python, the ability for the user to interact with a 3d bloch sphere. 
The user is able to rotate the bloch sphere and see the coordinates of the qubit state vector. The state vector is 
designated with a red-arrow like shape. Within the project, I am currently working on being able to actually move the state vector 
through the 3d bloch sphere, allowing the user to really get an understanding of how qubit state vectors move.
